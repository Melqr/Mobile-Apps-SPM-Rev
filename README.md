A mobile apps project for subject Mobile Programming , below is description about the project .


### Project Summary

**Introduction**

Education has significantly evolved with current technologies, making learning materials easily accessible online and facilitating rapid knowledge exchange. Mobile development has revolutionized education, allowing teachers to manage and share educational resources effortlessly. Traditionally, education has relied on textbooks and real-world interactions, which often fail to engage modern students due to their lack of interactivity.

This project focuses on the development of a mobile application designed for teachers who are preparing Form 5 students for the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) examinations in Physics. The application aims to store and manage Physics questions and answers, enabling teachers to efficiently organize and update study materials.

**Project Objectives**

1. **Develop a User-Friendly Mobile Application**: Create an engaging and easy-to-use app for teachers to manage and organize Physics questions and answers.
2. **Implement CRUD Actions**: Enable teachers to Create, Read, Update, and Delete Physics questions and answers, ensuring the database is always current and comprehensive.
3. **Organize Study Materials**: Allow teachers to efficiently store, update, and retrieve notes, quizzes, and past-year questions for each chapter in the Form 5 Physics syllabus.
4. **Streamline Resource Management**: Provide a centralized platform for teachers to manage study materials, ensuring consistency and ease of access.
5. **Enhance Educational Tools**: Develop features that help teachers assess students' understanding through quizzes and practice questions.

**Scope of the Project**

- **Focus**: Form 5 Physics subject.
- **Content**: Include notes, quizzes, and past-year questions for chapters 1 to 7.
- **Functionality**: Enable CRUD actions for managing Physics questions and answers.
- **Language**: The project will be primarily in English.

**Software Used**

- **Android Studio**: Development and code implementation.
- **Draw.IO**: Database ERD and flowchart design.
- **Miro**: User interface design before implementation in Android Studio.
- **SQLite**: Storing and retrieving data from the database.

This project aims to enhance the preparation of Form 5 students for the SPM Physics exam by providing teachers with a powerful tool to manage and organize educational resources efficiently.
